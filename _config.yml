  Hi, my name is Reza Baharani, and I have a Ph.D. degree in computer engineering. My thesis was about hardware acceleration and implementation of deep separable convolutional neural networks for micro-controller and FPGA platforms with a focus on both spatial (visual) and temporal (time series) domains.

  <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>C</mark>, and <mark>C++</mark> are my most proficient software programming languages, and <mark>SystemVerilog</mark> and <mark>VHDL</mark> are my best hardware modeling languages. <mark>PyTorch</mark> is also my main framework for modeling DNNs.

          Resource-Efficient Processing of Time Series on Edge
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          One dimension of deep learning, which has recently emerged in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), is time series analysis and forecasting. Recurrent networks, especially two elaborated models, namely, LSTM and GRU, are synonymous with time series analysis due to its notable success in sequence modeling problems. However, these models suffer from two significant issues: 1) gradient instability and 2) fewer levels of parallelization. I am currently working on a novel extension of TCN  for light-weight real-time sequence processing on embedded and edge devices for CPS applications. I have methodologically applied the acquired techniques in computer vision to TCN to decrease computational complexity and the model size of TCN to make it applicable for edge devices.

          An Integrative Algorithm/Architecture Co-Design for Deep Separable Convolutional Neural Networks
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I helped and mentored three master students to develop a fully vertical framework, named DeepDive, for agile implementation of state-of-the-art deep separable convolutions such as MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet families for the Xilinx Ultrascale Zynq MPSoC and U50 FPGA platforms.

          Lightweight Deep Learning for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction in Highways
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          For real-time vehicle trajectory prediction in highways, I developed DeepTrack as an agile algorithm with smaller model size and lower computational requirements. Contrary to previous methods, which used LSTMs, the vehicle dynamics were encoded with Agile Temporal Convolutional Networks (ATCNs) to provide more accurate time prediction with fewer computations.

          Real-time deep learning at the edge for scalable reliability modeling of Si-MOSFET power electronics converters
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Deep Learning Reliability Awareness of Converters at the Edge (Deep RACE) is a novel approach that allows for real-time reliability modeling and prediction of MOSFETs power electronics converters. Deep RACE offers a holistic solution that comprises algorithm advances and full system integration (from the cloud down to the edge node) to create a near real-time reliability awareness. On the algorithm side, we proposed a deep learning algorithmic solution based on stacked LSTM for collective reliability training and inference across multiple MOSFET converters.

          Real-Time Edge Video Analytics for Multicamera Privacy-Aware Pedestrian Tracking
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
         As communities utilize technologies such as smart traffic cameras, the resulting data enables detection of suspicious activity and anomaly behavior, as well as crowd behavior analysis. My involvement in this project included Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMCT). Two subtasks can be identified in MTMCT: 1) target reidentification (reID) and 2) target trajectory. The MTMCT is a drastically difficult task due to having multiple cameras with no overlapping scenes and an unknown number of people seen in the cameras. Our team worked on an ensemble of deep neural networks, such as ResNet-50, MobileNet-V2, tinyYOLO, and OpenPose, to reID a target and process its trajectory.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
